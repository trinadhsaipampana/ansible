To create roles we need to execute the following command in /etc/ansible/roles

ansible-galaxy init roleName

A new folder will be created with roleName with following sub-directories:

defaults
files
handlers
meta
tasks
templates
vars

We need to use these directories to define our requirements in respected main.yml in these directories. 

After completion of role, we need to write ansible playbook as follows:

---
- name: description
  hosts:
  become: true
  roles:
  - role1
  - role2

We can execute this playbook
