To create roles we need to execute the following command in /etc/ansible/roles

ansible-galaxy init roleName

A new folder will be created with roleName with following sub-directories:

defaults/main.yml --- used to define variables
files --- used to upload files required for the tasks
handlers/main.yml --- used to define handlers of the tasks
meta/main.yml --- used to define owner and description of the role
tasks/main.yml --- used to define tasks
templates
tests/test.yml --- used to define test cases
vars/main.yml --- used to define variables. This variables will be considered on priority

We need to use these directories to define our requirements in respected main.yml in these directories. 

After completion of role, we need to write ansible playbook as follows:

---
- name: description
  hosts:
  become: true
  roles:
  - role1
  - role2

We can execute this playbook
